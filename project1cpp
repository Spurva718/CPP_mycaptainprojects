#1.Write a C++ Program to Find Size of int, float, double and char in Your System Your output should look something like this Size of char: 1 byte Size of int: 4 bytes Size of float: 4 bytes Size of double: 8 bytes

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Size of char: " << sizeof(char) << " byte" << endl;
    cout << "Size of int: " << sizeof(int) << " bytes" << endl;
    cout << "Size of float: " << sizeof(float) << " bytes" << endl;
    cout << "Size of double: " << sizeof(double) << " bytes" << endl;

    return 0;
}


#2.Write a C++ Program to find the product of two numbers entered by the User Your Output should look something like this Enter two numbers: 3.4 5.5 Product = 18.7

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    float a,b,c;
    cout<<"Enter two Numbers: ";
    cin>>a>>b;
    c=a*b;
    cout<<"Product = "<<c;
    
    return 0;
}
